# CECS-579-Project
Project consists of 2 parts, executable obfuscation and licensing key library

This is a project for the class CECS 579, Information Security, at CSULB Fall 2015. The goal is to secure an executable with two strategies.
1. Executable obfuscation
2. Licensing key library
  a. executable package
  b. server package
  
Code will be written in C++, and I plan to use Crpyto++ for cryptographic tools.
